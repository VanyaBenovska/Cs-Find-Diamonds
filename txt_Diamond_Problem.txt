2.Diamond Problem
In the programming languages, which permit multiple inheritance, the diamond problem is a very common problem. In our task, the diamond problem is a bit more… money driven.
Your task is to write a program, which finds all diamonds in a string and calculates the carats of each diamond.
Each diamond will start with the character ‘<’. After that, it will be followed by several random characters (contents of the diamond). The diamond will end with the character ‘>’.
The carat value of the diamond is equal to the sum of all the digits in the contents of the diamond.
Example: “<2big32diamond>”  2 + 3 + 2 = 7 carats
If the given string contains one or more diamonds, print for each found diamond the following output:
•	Found {caratValueOfTheDiamond} carat diamond
If in the given string cannot be found any diamond, print:
•	Better luck next time

Examples:

Input01:	
empty<2big32diamond>useless<1another02Diamond>	
Output:
Found 7 carat diamond
Found 3 carat diamond

Input02:
No>diamonds<here	
Output:
Better luck next time
